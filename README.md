# E-commerce Back End

Description:
By using a mysql database, an ecommerce store site can be built and updated. MYSQL2, Express, Sequelize, and dotenv we're also used. The user must install npm init, npm install mysql2, npm install sequelize, npm install dotenv.

To run the application, the user will run in the command prompt mysql -u root -p, enter their password, then source db/schema.sql, quit. Next the user will run npm run seed and then npm start. The user will then be able to post, put and delete in Insomnia. Please watch the videos below for an example.
